# PyJSON <sub><sub>😎</sub></sub>

## Introduction.

This project is the result of my puny understanding of compilers, interpreters and parsers. I have implemented a json decoder and encoder with error handling. Clean design and a simple interface are a guarantee. Hope you like it. 🥺

This project is in its earliest of days and is not production ready, I mean, don't use it, just study it and maybe suggest any imrovements. 🥸
